# FlightSearcher

## Discription
FlightSearcher helps users find the flights combination which costs least time from one city to another, from all posibilities.  
This demo is a web version of a python project, for demonstration use only. Original functions are not fully implemented. 
you can run the demo here: <a href="https://zxy-ryan.github.io/FlightSearcher/">FlightSearcher</a>

## Raw Data
Air ports data: [Airports.txt](/rawdata/Airports.txt)
Flights data: [FlightsData.txt](/rawdata/FlightsData.txt)

## Statement of Work
1. Design a database through the raw data to represent a flight network. 
2. Read a graph from the database. 
3. Design an algorithm which finds all paths as well as the shortest path through the graph. A 'path' reprensts a flights combination. 
4. Display the result correctly on the map. For the web version, ArcGIS API for Javascript was used to display the map related functions.
